    <h2>Reverse engineering the NW-HD1 firmware update format</h2>

    <h3>Differences between ver. 2.000 and previous versions</h3>
    <p>
        Many people would like to update their NW-HD1 to ver 2.000, because, unlinke previous versions, it supports the playback of MP3 files.
    </p>
    <h3>The process</h3>
    <p>
        A few months ago, two members of the Minidisc Wiki Discord server (@___L___ and @richardhopton)
        have successfully managed to transfer the flash image from one Sony NW-HD1 (with ver. 2.000) with the use of the debug UART console and external programmers.
    </p>
    <p>
        During that process, it became clear that the Sony Firmware supports updating the flash on-device. Some <a href="assets/Technical Bulletin_Firmware Upgrading Procedure-1.pdf">internal documents</a> even describe the process.
        However, the files mentioned there are missing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, since the flash ROM containing version 2.000 got dumped, it should be possible to recreate the aforementioned <code>ZEP01.BIN</code> file.
        Knowing that, I decided to try and reverse engineer the HD1's firmware in Ghidra to try and find the update routines, which was surprisingly simple.
        <img class="img-contained block decomp" src="assets/routine.png" alt="Firmware update main routine">
        <span class="imagedesc">Main firmware update routine</span>    
    </p>
    <p>
        Before flashing the image file, the firmware reads the unencrypted header, and runs several checks:
        <ul>
            <li>Basic file size check / whether the file exists</li>
            <li>Comparing the file size declared in the file with its actual size</li>
            <li>Comparing the (inverted) CRC32 of the whole file excluding the final four bytes, with the final four bytes</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        After that check completes, the code decrypts the payload, and parses its header.
        The metadata header consists of 6 entries, each one 16 bytes long, with the format:
        <pre>
<span style='color:#6d8000; font-weight:bold; '>struct</span> UpdateHeaderEntry <span style='color:#406080; '>{</span>
    <span style='color:#6d8000; font-weight:bold; '>char</span> name<span style='color:#308080; '>[</span><span style='color:#008c00; '>4</span><span style='color:#308080; '>]</span><span style='color:#406080; '>;</span>
    <span style='color:#6d8000; font-weight:bold; '>uint32_t</span> dataSectionOffset<span style='color:#406080; '>;</span>
    <span style='color:#6d8000; font-weight:bold; '>uint32_t</span> length<span style='color:#406080; '>;</span>
    <span style='color:#6d8000; font-weight:bold; '>uint32_t</span> startOfSectionInROM<span style='color:#406080; '>;</span> <span style='color:#595979; '>// Unused in the HD1 / HD5, used in A1000</span>
<span style='color:#406080; '>};</span></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        The firmware then checks if the names of sections in the payload match its internal names.
        Locating that function makes it trivial to get the information about where each section is located, and what it's called:
        <ul>
            <li>HARU - located at 0x0, max length 0x4000 bytes</li>
            <li>NATU - located at 0x100000, max length 0x80000 bytes</li>
            <li>FUYU - located at 0xc0000, max length 0x40000 bytes</li>
        </ul>
        <img class="img-contained block decomp" src="assets/sections.png">
        <span class="imagedesc">
            Section loading routine:
            <span style="color: blue">length checks</span>,
            <span style="color: green">name checks</span>,
            <span style="color: red">offset from start of flash</span>
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the raw FLASH is usually mapped at address 0x01000000, after adding the offsets above and verifying the contents, I was able to confirm that the ROM sections are indeed located at the correct spots.
        I was able to cross-reference them with the sections provided by Sony in the NW-HD5 update file, which is publicly avaliable.
        After all that, I was able to simply recreate the original <code>ZEP01.BIN</code> by carving the sections from the appropriate addresses of the image.
    </p>
    <p>
        That resulted in a payload as follows:
        <img src="assets/payload.png" style="width: 100%;">
        <span>(Imhex format available <a href="assets/payload.pat">here</a>)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        All that was left to do was to encrypt it, and encapsulate it in the update file container:
        <pre>
<span style='color:#6d8000; font-weight:bold; '>struct</span> UpdateFile <span style='color:#406080; '>{</span>
    <span style='color:#595979; '>// Header:</span>
    <span style='color:#6d8000; font-weight:bold; '>char</span> fileId<span style='color:#308080; '>[</span><span style='color:#008c00; '>8</span><span style='color:#308080; '>]</span><span style='color:#406080; '>;</span> <span style='color:#595979; '>// The HD1 does not check the file ID. I just put "ZEP01BIN" there</span>
    <span style='color:#6d8000; font-weight:bold; '>uint32_t</span> size<span style='color:#406080; '>;</span> <span style='color:#595979; '>// Size of the payload + 16 bytes for the header</span>
    <span style='color:#6d8000; font-weight:bold; '>uint32_t</span> magic<span style='color:#406080; '>;</span> <span style='color:#595979; '>// The bytes 09 08 0b 0a</span>

    <span style='color:#6d8000; font-weight:bold; '>uint8_t</span> payload<span style='color:#308080; '>[</span><span style='color:#308080; '>]</span><span style='color:#406080; '>;</span>

    <span style='color:#6d8000; font-weight:bold; '>uint32_t</span> crc<span style='color:#406080; '>;</span> <span style='color:#595979; '>// CRC of the payload concatenated to the header</span>
<span style='color:#406080; '>}</span><span style='color:#406080; '>;</span></pre>
        After that, I was left with the <a href="assets/ZEP01.BIN">recreated ZEP01.BIN</a> update file.
        <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
        <h3>To flash:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Copy the ZEP01.bin file to the newly created "FWUPDATED" directory on the HD1</li>
            <li>Turn the HD1 on</li>
            <li>Open the menu</li>
            <li>Switch the hold switch on</li>
            <li>Enter the following button sequence with the MODE button pressed down: Right Right Left Left Right Left Right Left Play Play</li>
            <li>After entering that, you should be presented with the TEST MODE menu, with "FWUpdate" highlited. Press play to confirm</li>
            <li>Confirm wanting to update your firwmare</li>
            <li>Wait for the device to reboot. It should take approximately 30 seconds.</li>
