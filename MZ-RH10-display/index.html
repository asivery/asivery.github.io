    <p class="warning extreme">
        Even though I've tried my best to descibe all the steps as best as I could, I can't be held liable for any damages done to either the MZ-RH10 itself, or any other equipment used during the installation.
        Only proceed if you're comfortable with taking apart small electronics, and know how to solder. Otherwise, I strongly recommend seeking a local electonics proffessional, who would be willing to help with the installation.
    </p>
    <h2>Installation steps</h2>
    <h3>0. Remove the disc and battery</h3>
    <p>
        To make the replacement process as simple as possible, start off by removing the disc and the gumstick battery, as well as the sidecar (if present).
    </p>
    <h3>1. Taking off the main chassis</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            To start off, open the battery compartment, and remove the battery door - gently lift the pin and slide the door off.
        </p>
        <p class="warning">
            The plastics the MZ-RH10 is made out of have deteriorated since the device was manufactured, and therefore became brittle. It's very easy to end up with a cracked chassis. <strong>Be careful!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/02.JPG">
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, remove the 5 screws holding the main chassis in place.
            <ul>
                <li>Two are hidden in the battery compartment</li>
                <li>Two are on the side of the unit, next to the USB and barrel jack ports</li>
                <li>One is hidden behind the disc eject button</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/03.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            Slide the DC IN / USB door so that it covers the DC IN part - this will make it easier to pry the case open later.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/04.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            Slide two picks into the chassis:
            <ul>
                <li>First one below the battery connector</li>
                <li>Second one right next to the USB connector</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/05.JPG" alt="">
            <img src="photos/06.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            Very gently try to lift the device out of its case with the pick in the battery compartment. If the second pick is inserted correctly, you should be able to effortlessly lift the whole mechanism out.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Do not force anything open at this point</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="warning">The second pick is inserted very close to the magnetic head ribbon. You might rip it, if you're not careful.</p>
        <p>If you followed the steps correctly, you should end up with the chassis removed.</p>
        <p>

        </p>

        <p class="note">I highly recommend removing one of the clear pieces of plastic glued to the side of the mechanism. Unless removed, it can squish and tear the write head ribbon during reassembly.</p>

        <h3>2. Removing the lid board</h3>
        <p>
            After the machine is out of its chassis, it's time to remove the lid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Start by disconnecting the lid ribbon cable - unlatch it from its connector by sliding edges of the brown part as pointed out by the arrows. This should make it possible to simply slide out the ribbon cable, without the use of any force.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/08.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            Remove the lid spring - open the disc compartment, and unlatch the spring from the brass pin. Close the disc compartment afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/09.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            Unscrew the lid
        </p>
        <p class="warning">The screwes here are a different length. Keep track of them!</p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/10.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            Open the disc compartment, then carefully unlatch the lid from the rest of the mechanism. It should come off without requiring any force.
        </p>
        <!--<p>
            <img src="photos/11.JPG" alt="">
        </p>-->
        <p class="note">
            When reassembling, make sure to latch these components correctly!
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/09a.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <h3>2. Removing the front of the lid</h3>
        <p>
            Remove the four screws holding the midframe to the front of the lid.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/12.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
            Insert a pick between the lid PCB and the front of the lid.
        </p>
        <p class="warning">
            Do not insert it between the PCB and the midframe - you might end up cracking the PCB that way!
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/13.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>Slide another pick from the top, between the old OLED and the front of the lid. The screen is partially glued, and needs to be pried out.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/14.JPG" alt="">
            <img src="photos/15.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>3. Removing the dead screen</h3>
        <p>Remove the tape covering the OLED connector</p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/16.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>Slice off the pins off of the old OLED's ribbon</p>
        <p class="note">Alternatively, you can desolder this ribbon. I, however, found it easier to simply slice the pins off, then clean them up afterwards.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/17.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>Slice the adhesive holding the old ribbon in place as well.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/18.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>Afterwards, lift the ribbon up</p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/19.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>The OLED is also adhered using a small strip of tape. Gently lift it up and out from the bottom.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/20.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>Clean up the solder pads with new solder</p>
        <p class="note">Don't forget to add flux! It will help the solder flow.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/21.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>4. Installing the new OLED module</h3>
        <p>Remove the adhesive backing from the new OLED, then carefully position it in the RH10's midframe.</p>
        <p class="warning">Make sure the pins touching the RH10's board are straight!</p>
        <p class="warning">Double check the alignment! Make sure absolutely everything is straight at this point. It will be very hard to remove the OLED module after soldering it.</p>
        <p class="warning">The OLED module has only 30 pins, whereas the old panel has 31 - this is normal. The 31st pin should not be soldered.</p>
        <p>Example of bad alignment</p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/bad_alignment_revc.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>Example of good alignment</p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/good_alignment_revc.JPG">
        </p>
        <p>
            After you're happy with the alingment, solder the screen down
        </p>
        <p class="note">Using a fair bit of flux will help immensely.</p>
        <p>After you solder the display down, power the device up - connect the lid board to the main board, without putting the lid together.</p>
        <p class="warning">Before plugging the battery in, make sure you have no shorts on the display connector. <span class="extreme">Some pins on this connector have a high (+12V) potential on them. Bridging these pins with any others will cause permanent damage to both the replacement module and the MZ-RH10 itself.</span></p>
        <p>After latching the lid midframe back and gently pressing the whole disc compartment down (nothing will hold it in place without the actual lid), you should be greeted by the replacement module's test mode. It will report on the amount of changes it saw on each pin since the device's power up. <span class="warning">If you see any pins with zero changes, resolder them. If the test mode does not show up, resolder the last 3 pins (pin #23, #29 and #30 - 2.5V, GND and 12V).</span></p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/testmode.JPG">
        </p>
        <p>After confirming there are changes being detected on every pin, solder down the "test mode disable" jumper.</p>
        <p>Now, after powering the device up again, you should see the correct data on the screen.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="photos/23_revc.JPG" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>Once you're sure the display works correctly, clean all the flux with isopropyl alcohol, then insulate the board with capton tape.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>That's it!</h3>
        <p>To put your MZ-RH10 back together, follow these instructions in the reverse order. Be sure to never use excessive force! These components should all slot back in with perfect ease.</p>
